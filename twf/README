Trivial Web Framework
=====================

twf is a web framework designed to get out of your way. It's supposed
to help you when it can, but if you are doing ok, it's supposed to be
not there. It relies heavily on existing Python packages that you
might be familiar with, like wsgiref and tempita.

Configuration File
------------------

twf tries to load /etc/twf.conf and ~/.twf.conf as ini-style
configuration files. If you don't like that, use the twf.config object
to load other files.

[session]
