<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>The Gradient Material Index describes the current market prices of
  various production-relevant materials in the Republic. It is used by
  Gradient for purchase and sale. We buy minerals and many other
  materials at index price in our production offices.</p>

<p>While the index also gives the region-specific prices and also the
  Jita price, this is mostly for convenience and as a quick reference.
  Although when there is not enough trade in a material in the
  Republic, we fall back to the Jita price.</p>

<h2>Index Source</h2>

<p>The index is calculated as the 7-day average of all material
  purchases and sales in the Republic proper (Heimatar, Metropolis and
  Molden Heath). This refers to the <em>market history</em> in your
  neocom, not the currently available orders. The 7-day average gives
  some robustness against sporadic fluctuations.</p>

<p>The data is regularly uploaded by our pilots. This sometimes can
  result in slightly outdated data. The index marks prices based on
  data older than 3 days with an orange exclamation mark, and prices
  based on data older than 7 days with a red exclamation mark. You can
  hover your cursor over the exclamation marks to see details.</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>For each region, we first try to calculate the 7-day average. If
  this is not available, it uses the 28-day average (4 weeks). If this
  is also not available, we fall back to the 364-day average (52
  weeks). If this does not exist, either, we use a price of 0.0 and a
  volume of 0.</p>

<p>Then, to calculate the Republic index, we base the data on the
  indeces for the three regions of the Republic proper: Heimatar,
  Metropolis and Molden Heath, again using the 7d/28/d/364d averages
  as above. If for the resuling price is 0.0, or if the trade volume
  in the Republic is less than 1% of the trade volume in Jita, we fall
  back to the Jita price.</p>
